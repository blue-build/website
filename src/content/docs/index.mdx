## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Easy configuration" icon="pencil">
		The build process can be configured entirely in a straightforward YAML format or web UI (coming soon).
	</Card>
	<Card title="Totally extensible" icon="add-document">
		The modular build system can easily be extended by just writing a shell script.
    Modules you create can be added into the official BlueBuild repository or your own for the community to take advantage of.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Based on well-known standards" icon="puzzle">
		The format of your OS images is the familiar OCI image format, famously used by Docker & Podman.
    With Fedora's Native Container support, it becomes possible to boot natively into a OCI compatible image.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Free & open-source" icon="open-book">
		BlueBuild is an open-source project built by the community for the community.
    Feel free to peek at & tinker with the source code!
    GitHub also provides CI/CD & a container registry for free, though other providers are supported as well.
	</Card>
  <Card title="Effortless reliability" icon="information">
		With your custom images being based on reliable atomic distributions, your setup will be rock solid.
    As all errors related to customizing your environment happen during the build process in the cloud, it's way harder to end up with a bricked system.

## FAQ

### Is this site ready?

Not at all! Basically none of the documentation pages have content, & work hasn't even started on the tooling part.
But you can help us in the [GitHub](https://github.com/blue-build/website) repo!
