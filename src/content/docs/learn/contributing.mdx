BlueBuild is an open source (Apache 2.0) community project maintained by volunteers. Your contribution is very welcome!  
Make sure you have read the [Code of Conduct](/community#code-of-conduct) before contributing, and only contribute content that you have authored and have the right to license under the project license.

We try to follow [Lazy Concensus](https://community.apache.org/committers/decisionMaking.html), so feel free to [be bold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold) with PRs.

Most developer discussion happens in `#dev` on the Discord and the GitHub Issues, Pull Requests, and Discussions. Use the Discord for more synchronous conversation, and GitHub for things that shouldn't be forgotten and require more discussion and coordination. See [Community](/community).

## How to contribute

If you are new to git and/or GitHub, check out [GitHub's guide on contributing](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project).

When creating git commits and titling pull requests, please make sure to adhere to [Convential Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) guidelines. Your commit messages and pull requests should always start with a type like `fix:` or `feat:`. Scopes can be useful when working on modules, for example `fix(default-flatpaks): make notifications work`.
