## Common issues

### `ghcr.io: denied: permission_denied: write_package`

If you're trying to build an image with the same name as something you've already built from a new repository, you might get this GitHub permission error. This happens because the GitHub package entry was created by the other repository, which is now attached to it.   
To fix this issue:

1. Go to the "Packages" tab on your GitHub profile.
2. Choose the package you are trying to build.
3. Open "Package settings".
4. Under "Manage Actions access", add your new repository and give it the "Admin" role.
5. Manually re-trigger build.
