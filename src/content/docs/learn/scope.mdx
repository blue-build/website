The BlueBuild project can be summarized in five key points:

-   **Mission**: The primary goal of BlueBuild is to make the process of creating custom images of existing Linux distributions accessible and user-friendly.
-   **Approach**: BlueBuild achieves its goal through _automation_ and _abstraction_. By automating tasks and abstracting away complex processes, users can focus less on technical details and more on their specific needs.
-   **Core**: The core of BlueBuild is its tooling; the process of turning a well-defined [recipe](/reference/recipe/) format into a functional custom image by utilizing modules.
-   **Documentation**: BlueBuild seeks to maintain quality documentation that provides useful information about making custom images and insight into the inner workings of the project itself.
-   **Community**: BlueBuild aims to foster a healthy community of Linux users and enthusiasts, particularly those interested in custom image creation. Its community spaces serve as a platform for discussion, collaboration, and sharing ideas related to this topic.
