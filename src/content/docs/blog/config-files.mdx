A [previous update](/blog/caching-update) split the original `config/` directory into two parts, `config/` and the newly created `recipes/`, because we realized that it did not make sense to include files that will be copied into the image and configuration files used for generating the Containerfile (the lower-level build-instructions) in the same directory anymore.

This update left us at a weird state, though, because the directory that no longer contained image configuration, just files to be copied into the image, was called `config/`. We didn't want to just rename `config/` to `files/`, though, because that would have created the weirdly named directory `files/files/` used by the `files` module (very confusing).

What we opted to in addition to renaming `config/` to `files/` is giving the `files` module access to the entire `files/` directory. This keeps the convention of each module reading files from a folder named after itself, while unlocking better ways to organize files when using the `files` module.

This is a small and non-critical change, and **existing configurations will continue to be supported for the time being**. Our small team of volunteers is constantly working on improving the UX of BlueBuild and slowly integrating new features. We still have multiple similar refactors planned to increase the general cohesion of the whole system, so stay tuned to see us evolve.

And now the part you're here for...

## Migration

0. Make sure you've done the [caching update migration](/blog/caching-update#migration) that introduced the `recipes/` folder.
1. Rename your `config/` directory to `files/`.
2. If you're already working with a _1-to-1 filetree mapping_ structure, where you have root folders with names such as `usr` or `etc` that are copied into the image (as is the default), do the following:
    1. Move all such folders into the directory `files/system/`
    2. Change your files module configuration (or just the part that copied those folders) to below:
        ```yaml
        type: files
        files:
            - source: system
              destination: /
        ```
        (notice that this is also using the new explicit source/destination syntax added in the same update)
3. If you're using the `files` module to copy other kinds of folders outside of the _1-to-1 filetree mapping_ for example using a copying a folder called `wallpapers` into the directory containing the default wallpapers in your environment, you may add those folders directly inside the `files/` directory and copy them to the correct place similarly to the snippet above.
4. You're good to go! Commit your changes and wait to see that your custom image builds correctly.
