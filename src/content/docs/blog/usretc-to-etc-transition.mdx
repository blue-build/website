Hello BlueBuilders!

In this blog post, it will be explained on why the usage of `/etc/` is recommended over `/usr/etc/` in build-time.

It is often recommended in Fedora Atomic space that the system files should be placed in `/usr/etc/`, while files in `/etc/` are reserved for local-users to make edits.

While this is true in run-time, this is technically not true in build-time (emphasis on technically).

It is a recent discovery of [Universal Blue folks](https://github.com/ublue-os) & [Rechunk developer Antheas](https://github.com/antheas) that `ostree` has different behavior regarding `/usr/etc/` & `/etc/` relationship in build-time.  
Also thanks to the [RedHat employee & `ostree` maintainer Colin Walters](https://github.com/cgwalters) who directly notified them of this.

## Why to transition
When files are placed directly to `/usr/etc/` in build-time, no issues are noted & everything works fine for now.

However, it is still not the ideal thing to do, since we are relying on undefined `rpm-ostree` behavior in this case, which can stop working anytime.

Quoting Antheas:  
:::note
When OSTree commits get converted to OCI, /usr/etc/ becomes /etc/.
Then during deployment, new /etc/ files are silently moved to /usr/etc/.

Relying on /usr/etc/ to place modified files in customized packages is a hack
and relies on undefined behavior in the rpm-ostree source code that performs
the path rewriting.
:::

As can be seen from the 1st paragraph of the note above, this is how `ostree` functions & this is why it's desired to transition to `/etc/`.
`/etc/` files in build-time are copied to `/usr/etc/` during deployment, so image users will note no changes.

## How to transition

Copy any files that you have from `/usr/etc/` to `/etc/`.

Profit!
