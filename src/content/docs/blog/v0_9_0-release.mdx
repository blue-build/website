:::tip[TLDR]
The BlueBuild CLI `v0.9.0` update introduces new features and breaking changes. [What do I need to do to migrate?](#breaking_changes)
:::

# Features

- Generate ISOs for a fresh install
- New `init` command for creating a new BlueBuild project
- Stages for compiling your favorite programs while keeping dev tools out of your image
- Copy module for copying programs from stages into your final image
- A new `switch` command consolidates `upgrade`/`rebase` commands
- A new `login` command for logging into registries for all tools like `docker`, `skopeo`, `cosign`, etc.
- A new `validate` command and check before building that will tell you where you have errors in your recipes
- A new `prune` command to easily clean build space for the build drivers
- The `sigstore` driver that can handle signing if you don't have `cosign` installed
- The ability to build multiple recipes at the same time

# Breaking Changes

- Local modules must now have the `source` property set to `local`

```yaml
modules:
  - type: custom-module
    source: local
    input:
      - value 1
      - value 2
```

- Removal of `yq` and the `get_yaml_array` bash function from the build in favor of `jq` and the new `get_json_array`
- Minimum supported version of `buildah` is now `1.29` up from `1.24`
