A `recipe.yml` file is used to configure a custom image. The top-level keys are used to set the metadata and base, and modules are used to add things on top of the base.

### `name:`

The image name. Used when publishing to GHCR as `ghcr.io/<user>/<name>`.

#### Example:

```yaml
# config/recipe.yml
name: weird-os
```

### `description:`

The image description. Published to GHCR in the image metadata.

#### Example:

```yaml
# config/recipe.yml
description: This is my personal OS image.
```

### `base-image:`

The [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) image to base your custom image on. Only atomic Fedora images and those based on them are officially supported. Universal Blue is recommended. A list of uBlue images can be found on the [uBlue website](https://universal-blue.org/images/). BlueBuild-built images can be used as well.

#### Example:

```yaml
# config/recipe.yml
base-image: ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main
```

### `image-version:`

The tag of the base image to build on. Used to select a version explicitly (`39`) or to always use the latest stable version (`latest`). A list of all available tags can be viewed by pasting your `base-image` url into your browser.

#### Example:

```yaml
# config/recipe.yml
image-version: 39
```

### `modules:`

A list of [modules](/reference/module/) that is executed in order. Multiple of the same module can be included.

Each item in this list should have at least a `type:` or be specified to be included from an external file in the `config/` directory with `from-file:`.

#### Example:

```yaml
# config/recipe.yml
modules:
    - type: rpm-ostree
      # rest of the module config...
    - from-file: common-packages.yml
```

The included file can have one or multiple modules:

```yaml
# config/common-packages.yml
# one module
type: rpm-ostree
# rest of the module config...
```

```yaml
# config/common-packages.yml
# multiple modules
modules:
    - type: script
      # rest of the module config...
    - type: rpm-ostree
      # rest of the module config...
```
