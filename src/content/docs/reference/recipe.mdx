---

A `recipe.yml` file describes the build process of a custom image. The top-level keys set the metadata and base for the image, and modules are build steps that add things on top of the base.

### `name:`

The image name. Used when publishing to GHCR as `ghcr.io/<user>/<name>`.

#### Example:

```yaml
# recipes/recipe.yml
name: weird-os
```

### `description:`

The image description. Published to GHCR in the image metadata.

#### Example:

```yaml
# recipes/recipe.yml
description: This is my personal OS image.
```

### `alt-tags:` (optional)

Allows setting custom tags on the recipe's final image. Adding tags to this property will override the `latest` and timestamp tags.

#### Example:

```yaml
alt-tags:
  - gts
  - stable
```

### `base-image:`

The [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) image to base your custom image on. Only atomic Fedora images and those based on them are officially supported. Universal Blue is recommended. A list of uBlue images can be found on the [uBlue website](https://universal-blue.org/images/). BlueBuild-built images can be used as well.

#### Example:

```yaml
# recipes/recipe.yml
base-image: ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main
```

### `image-version:`

The tag of the base image to build on. Used to select a version explicitly (`40`) or to always use the latest stable version (`latest`). A list of all available tags can be viewed by pasting your `base-image` url into your browser.

#### Example:

```yaml
# recipes/recipe.yml
image-version: 40
```

### `stages:` (optional)

A list of [stages](/references/stages/) that are executed before the build of the final image. This is useful for compiling programs from source without polluting the final bootable image.

#### Example:

```yaml
stages:
  - name: bluebuild
    from: docker.io/library/rust:1.77
    modules: # same as the top-level modules key, but executed in the custom stage
      - type: script
        no-cache: true
        snippets:
          - cargo install --locked --all-features blue-build
```

### `modules:`

A list of [modules](/reference/module/) that is executed in order. Multiple of the same module can be included.

Each item in this list should have at least a `type:` or be specified to be included from an external file in the `recipes/` directory with `from-file:`.

#### Example:

```yaml
# recipes/recipe.yml
modules:
  - type: rpm-ostree
    # rest of the module config...
  - from-file: common-packages.yml
```

The included file can have one or multiple modules:

```yaml
# recipes/common-packages.yml
# one module
type: rpm-ostree
# rest of the module config...
```

```yaml
# recipes/common-packages.yml
# multiple modules
modules:
  - type: script
    # rest of the module config...
  - type: rpm-ostree
    # rest of the module config...
```
