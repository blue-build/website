A `recipe.yml` file is used to configure a custom image. The top-level keys are used to set the metadata and base, and modules are used to add things on top of the base.

### `name:`

The image name. Used when publishing to GHCR as `ghcr.io/<user>/<name>`.

### `description:`

The image description. Published to GHCR in the image metadata.

The [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/) image to base your custom image on. Only atomic Fedora images and those based on them are officially supported. Universal Blue is recommended. A list of uBlue images can be found on the [uBlue website](https://universal-blue.org/images/). BlueBuild-built images can be used as well. 

Example:
```
base-image: ghcr.io/ublue-os/silverblue-main
```

### `image-version:`

The tag of the base image to build on. Used to select a version explicitly (`39`) or to always use the latest stable version (`latest`). A list of all available tags can be viewed by pasting your `base-image` url into your browser.

Example:
```
image-version: 39
```
