When your needs grow beyond just one user on one machine, you might want to build multiple versions of your custom image for different use cases or based on different base images. This guide outlines the configuration steps required to build multiple images out of a single repository.

1. Create a new recipe file.
    - To make this easier, you might want to just duplicate and rename your other recipe file.
    - Make sure to name your recipe files accordingly, for example: `recipe-gnome.yml` for a GNOME version of your image and `recipe-kde.yml` for a KDE version of your image.
2. Edit your new recipe file. You should _at least_ change the name of the image to prevent collision with your other image, but other changes can also made at this point.
3. Open the build workflow file in `.github/workflows/build.yml` and edit the list of recipe files under `jobs: bluebuild: strategy: matrix: recipe:` to contain all the recipes you want to build.
    - The list simply consists of paths under the `config/` folder in your git repository. For example, if you have many recipes and want to store them all in a subdirectory like `config/recipes/`, you can use them in `build.yml` by specifying the subdirector; `recipes/recipe.yml`.
    - After this step, all versions of your custom images should start building.
