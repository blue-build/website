This guide shows you how to include module configuration into your recipe from an external file. This is useful if you're [building multiple images](/how-to/multiple-images) or your recipe file is just getting cluttered.

1. Create a new YAML file for your module(s) inside the `config/` directory.
2. Add your module configuration into the file.
    - The file can configure just one module like this:
        ```yaml
        # config/common-flatpaks.yml
        type: default-flatpaks
        system:
            install: 
                - org.blender.Blender
        ```
    - Or it can configure multiple modules by declaring them under `modules:`:
        ```yaml
        # config/common-modules.yml
        modules:
            - type: signing
            - type: files
              files:
                - usr: /usr
            - type: fonts
              fonts:
                nerd-fonts:
                    - Hack
            - from-file: common-packages.yml
        ```
3. Import your module configuration file in your recipe with [`from-file:`](http://localhost:4321/reference/recipe/#modules).
    - Example:
        ```yaml
        # recipe.yml
        # ...rest of the recipe
        modules:
            - from-file: common-modules.yml
            - from-file: common-flatpaks.yml
        ```
