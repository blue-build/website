This guide shows you how to set up [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) container signing for a BlueBuild custom image repository. This guide is useful when manually setting up a new repository, or regenerating keys for a pre-existing one. Setting up container signing is important for security and verifiability. This guide requires either [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) or [`skopeo`](https://github.com/containers/skopeo), so make sure one of those is installed before proceeding. If you don't already have either one of those installed, it is recommended you [install cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/system_config/installation/).

1. Inside your repository, generate a new key pair. Do NOT put in a password when it asks you to, just press enter. The signing key will be used in GitHub Actions and will not work if it is encrypted.
    - with cosign:
        ```bash
        # generates cosign.pub and cosign.key
        cosign generate-key-pair
        ```
    - with skopeo:
        ```bash
        # generates cosign.pub and cosign.private
        skopeo generate-sigstore-key --output-prefix cosign
        ```
2. Add the private key to your GitHub repository secrets
    - This can be done manually on GitHub:
        1. Open your repository's settings.
        2. From the sidebar, pick "Secrets and Variables" and "Actions".
        3. Create a new repository secret called `SIGNING_SECRET` and for its value copy the contents of your `cosign.key`/`cosign.private` file.
    - This can also be done manually with the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), if that is installed:
        ```bash
        gh secret set SIGNING_SECRET < cosign.key # or cosign.private
        ```
3. Commit the `cosign.pub` file into your git repository, so that it can be used for verification. The file should always be in the root of your repository.
