This guide shows you how to use [Bluebuild CLI][bluebuild-cli-repo] to do the following things locally, without depending on the [BlueBuild GitHub Action][bluebuild-cli-ghaction]:

- preview the `Containerfile` generated your `recipe.yml` locally;
- test your `recipe.yml` build process locally before pushing to GitHub;
- install a locally built image onto a virtual machine;
- rebase your currently running operating system onto a locally built image;

## Installing BlueBuild CLI

The BlueBuild CLI tool is installed by default on images built using BlueBuild. There are also several methods available for installing the BlueBuild CLI tool, documented in the [BlueBuild CLI README][bluebuild-cli-readme].

## Using BlueBuild CLI

The [repository README][bluebuild-cli-readme-howtouse] has general instructions for using the `bluebuild` CLI tool. Example use cases for some of the commands follow in the sections below. You can also view the help text for the commands using the `--help` argument on every subcommand.

### Generate

The `generate` command allows you to create the `Containerfile` used to build your recipe. It will print to stdout unless you use the `--output/-o <FILE_PATH>` argument:

```bash
bluebuild generate ./recipes/recipe.yml -o Containerfile
```

If your recipe makes use of the [`from-file:`][bluebuild-cli-from-file] syntax, it can sometimes get confusing to know the exact order of all the module calls in your recipe. You can make use of the `--display-full-recipe/-d` argument and it will generate your full `recipe.yml` file with all recipe snippets included:

```bash
bluebuild generate -d ./recipes/recipe.yml
```


### Build

The `build` command builds an image from a recipe; you can use this command to test your recipe locally before pushing the recipe to GitHub:

```bash
bluebuild build ./recipes/recipe.yml
```

You can see that the BlueBuild GitHub Action [uses the same `build` command][bluebuild-cli-ghaction-build], with additional `--push` and `--registry` options for pushing successful build to `ghcr.io` or similar image repositories.

You can see the complete list of available options using `bluebuild build --help`.

### Switch

The `switch` command is a workflow command. It will build your image, export it to a `.tar.gz` file, and call `rpm-ostree rebase`/`rpm-ostree upgrade` with the file as the target instead of a OCI image:

```bash
bluebuild switch ./recipes/recipe.yml
```

To trigger an immediate reboot for either command, you can pass in the `--reboot/-r` argument.
