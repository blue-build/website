This guide shows you how to use [Bluebuild CLI][bluebuild-cli-repo] to do the following things locally, without depending on the [BlueBuild GitHub Action][bluebuild-cli-ghaction]:

- preview the `Containerfile` generated your `recipe.yml` locally;
- test your `recipe.yml` build process locally before pushing to GitHub;
- install a locally built image onto a virtual machine;
- rebase your currently running operating system onto a locally built image;

## Installing BlueBuild CLI

The BlueBuild CLI tool is installed by default on images built using BlueBuild. There are also several methods available for installing the BlueBuild CLI tool, documented in the the [BlueBuild CLI README][bluebuild-cli-readme].

## Using BlueBuild CLI

The [repository README][bluebuild-cli-readme-howtouse] has general instructions for using the `bluebuild` CLI tool. Example use cases for some of the commands follow in the sections below.

### Build

The `build` command builds an image from a recipe; you can use this command to test your recipe locally before pushing the recipe to GitHub:

```bash
bluebuild build ./config/recipe.yml
```

You can see that the BlueBuild GitHub Action [uses the same `build` command][bluebuild-cli-ghaction-build], with additional `--push` and `--registry` options for pushing successful build to `ghcr.io` or similar image repositories.

You can see the complete list of available options using `bluebuild build help`.
